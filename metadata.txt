name=Digitize local coordinates
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=Digitizes in distances from a local coordinate system
version=0.3
author=Morten Sickel
email=morten@sickel.net

about=Input coordinates relative to a local coordinate system. E.g. when planning modifications of buildings. Make one line cover with the first line defining the x-axis of the local system. The starting point of the first line will be the origin, the difference between the start and the end of the first line defines the direction of the coordinate system. The units are as defined in the CRS of the layer. The work layer should be in the same CRS as the reference layer. The libes in the work layer can be defined either as start and end point, or as a starting point and the angle (as degrees from the y-axis) and the length. If to x and/or to y is left blank, angle and length is used. Type in the definition a line and press "Add line" to add it to the work layer.
